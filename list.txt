Mythos - Stephen Fry
Heroes: Volume II of Mythos - Stephen Fry

Dark Matter - Blake Crouch
Kiss an Angel - Susan Elizabeth Phillips [Amazing book]
Recursion - Blake Crouch [Another amazing book. Eons better than his other book Dark Matter]
Project Hail Mary - Andy Weir [Incredible and heartwarming]
The Martian - Andy Weir [Enjoyable but not as amazing as Project Hail Mary]

[21/04/2022]
Exhalation - Ted Chiang [Lukewarm Enjoyable. Physical book. Really Liked "Exhalation", "Truth of Fact, Truth of Feeling", "Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom"]

[08/05/2022]
Stories Of Your Life and Others - Ted Chiang [Physical book. Brilliant writing in general. The first story "Tower of Babylon" was a bit underwhelming.
                                              "Understand" was a really fun read. I enjoyed "Liking What You See: A Documentary" the best; The concept of "calliagnosia" was thought provoking.
                                              "Seventy-Two Letters" and "The Evolution of Human Science" were good but not gripping.
                                              Didn't enjoy "Hell is the Absense of God". I wasn't able to appreciate the story or the message.
                                              The main story "Stories of your Life" that Denis Villeneuve's Arrival is based on was an interesting read but shorter than I expected and not as exciting in contrast to the film]
[16/05/2022]
Caves of Steel - Isaac Asimov [Physical book. First re-read after 7 years. Great novel]

[26/05/2022]
The Naked Sun - Isaac Asimov [Physical book. Re-read. Great novel and ending]

[07/06/2022]
The Robots of Dawn - Isaac Asimov [Physical book. Re-read. Amazing ending as usual]

[22/06/2022]
Robots and Empire - Isaac Asimov [Physical book. Re-read. Great ending to Asimov's Robot series]

[01/07/2022]
Prelude to Foundation - Isaac Asimov [Weak start for a Foundation novel but a good and interesting ending that ties well with the rest of the series]

[22/07/2022]
Foundation - Isaac Asimov [Physical Book. Re-read. Started off a bit underwhelming compared to how I remembered it from the last re-read but a great ending]

[29/07/2022]
Foundation and Empire - Isaac Asimov [Physical Book. Re-read. Entertaining read and enjoyable ending]

[08/08/2022]
Second Foundation - Isaac Asimov [Re-read. Great ending]

[16/08/2022]
The Silent Patient - Alex Michaelides [Fun read. Well written. Interesting but predictable twist in the end]

[28/08/2022]
Children of Time - Adrian Tchaikovsky [Incredible feat of imagination. Amazing ending]

[27/10/2022]
Recursion - Blake Crouch [Physical book. Re-read. Amazing read as expected. On this re-read, the first half was just as exciting as my first time reading, the middle a bit slow, the ending was great though]


[20/03/2023]
The End of Eternity - Isaac Asimov [Entertaining read. Enjoyable ending. Liked Asimov's descriptions of time travel and terms for the temporal like homewhen, upwhen and downwhen]

[30/03/2023]
Blood Music - Greg Bear [Lukewarm entertaining read. Brilliant concept albiet pulpy writing. Love the title of the book - "Blood Music"]

[07/04/2023]
Me Before You - Jojo Moyes [Wonderful read. I really liked the characters and ending]

[03/05/2023]
Dogs of War - Adrian Tchaikovsky [Entertaining and surprisingly emotional sci-fi. My second Adrian Tchaikovsky novel after Children of Time.
                                  With his Zoology background, he's really good at writing anthropomorphic characters, describing animal characteristics and psychology in his works]

[21/06/2023]
Homo Deus - Yuval Noah Harari [An entertaining and thought provoking read even though a bit preachy at times.
                               Some of the topics explored were more interesting than Sapiens]

[05/07/2023]
Perfume: The Story of a Murderer - Patrick SÃ¼skind

[10/07/2023]
The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck - Mark Manson [Re-read. Physical book. Don't remember when I read it last. Surprisingly, a lot of wisdom to be found in this one]

[03/08/2023]
Fireflies from the Future - Abhishek Mittal [Excellent debut novel from an Indian author. Impactful ending. Gave me a lot of insight into Indian socio-politics and the forces at play within the nation. Looking forward to future works from this author]

[01/11/2023]
21 Lessons for the 21st Century - Yuval Noah Harari [Informative and entertaining to read. Lots of great insights on human subjective experience and how we shape our reality]

[11/11/2023]
Childhood's End - Arthur C. Clarke [This is my third read. The first time was back in 2013, ten years ago, and it was quite an emotional read, especially the ending.
                                    Now, the first part of the novel was engaging, a bit slow in the middle but the ending was gripping once again.
                                    Though, not as emotional as I felt the first time I read it]

[28/12/2023]
Sophie's World - Jostein Gaarder [Educational and enjoyable read. Though a bit dry in some places, it's a nice casual primer on western philosophy.
                                  I quite enjoyed the chapter on Romanticism and the last one on the universe and Big Bang.
                                  The characters were quirky and fun to read. The twist at the end was melancholic but enjoyable in a "sad is happy for deep people" kind of way. 
                                  It tied well into the philsophical theme and ended on a hopeful note]


[21/02/2024]
Never Let Me Go - Kazuo Ishiguro [An emotional read. A bit dark and melancholic but in an enjoyable way]

[12/04/2024]
Sapiens - Yuval Noah Harari [First re-read after 2019. 10th anniversary edition hardcover. Enjoyed reading it again] 

[15/06/2024]
The Collapsing Empire - John Scalzi [First novel finished on my new Kindle. Quite fun and engaging. 
                                     The characters though not every complex were a hoot to read. Especially Kiva, though she's a bit of an asshole.
                                     I liked Scalzi's writing in this with its casual use of language that reminds me of pulp SF of old. I really should give his other novel Old Man's War another go. I DNFed it a couple of times before.
                                     I'm going to continue the Interdependency series]

[30/06/2024]
The Consuming Fire - John Scalzi [Novel 2 of the Interdependency series. Scalzi knocks it out of the park again with this one. This was in many ways more engaging than the first novel. Looking forward to reading the third one]

[07/07/2024]
The Last Emperox - John Scalzi [Novel 3 and finale of the Interdependency series. What an absolute banger. Lots of unceremonious deaths and people blowing up as is Scalzi's style but I thoroughly enjoyed the ending.
                                This series(the whole trilogy) is worth a re-read in the future. It would totally hit different to read it all knowing the ending and not diminish the reading experience in any way]

[10/08/2024]
Patriots and Partisans - Ramachandra Guha [My first Guha book. I was instantly taken by his style of exposition, engaging and easy to process for a sheltered Indian history noob like myself.
                                           I found his moderate political views and subtle sense of humor condusive to my personal taste. 
                                           Learned quite a bit about Indian politics/history, in a way that wasn't intimidating, on the contrary actually quite rewarding, and perhaps serving as an antidote to the chaos and confusion of identity politics on online forums that's been doing my head in the last year and a half.
                                           I'm excited to read more of his work in the coming days]

[29-08-2024]
Lathe of Heaven - Ursula K. Le Guin [What a mind-trip. My first proper read and completed novel of Le Guin, even though I've known about her for over 10 years now, I tried to get into her work before without success. Really enjoyed this one] 

[28-10-2024]
The Unhoneymooners - Christina Lauren [Cute but lukewarm read]

[17-11-2024]
Bottle of Lies: The Inside Story of the Generic Drug Boom - Katherine Eban [What a ride. Learned quite a bit about the pharma industry and how drugs are made and regulated. Definitely not looking at a strip of tablets the same way again]
