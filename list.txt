Exhalation - Ted Chiang [Lukewarm Enjoyable. Physical book. Really Liked "Exhalation", "Truth of Fact, Truth of Feeling", "Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom"]

[08/05/2022]
Stories Of Your Life and Others - Ted Chiang [Physical book. Brilliant writing in general. The first story "Tower of Babylon" was a bit underwhelming.
                                              "Understand" was a really fun read. I enjoyed "Liking What You See: A Documentary" the best; The concept of "calliagnosia" was thought provoking.
                                              "Seventy-Two Letters" and "The Evolution of Human Science" were good but not gripping.
                                              Didn't enjoy "Hell is the Absense of God". I wasn't able to appreciate the story or the message.
                                              The main story "Stories of your Life" that Denis Villeneuve's Arrival is based on was an interesting read but shorter than I expected and not as exciting in contrast to the film]
[16/05/2022]
Caves of Steel - Isaac Asimov [Physical book. First re-read after 7 years. Great novel]

[26/05/2022]
The Naked Sun - Isaac Asimov [Physical book. Re-read. Great novel and ending]

[07/06/2022]
The Robots of Dawn - Isaac Asimov [Physical book. Re-read. Amazing ending as usual]

[22/06/2022]
Robots and Empire - Isaac Asimov [Physical book. Re-read. Great ending to Asimov's Robot series]

[01/07/2022]
Prelude to Foundation - Isaac Asimov [Weak start for a Foundation novel but a good and interesting ending that ties well with the rest of the series]

[22/07/2022]
Foundation - Isaac Asimov [Physical Book. Re-read. Started off a bit underwhelming compared to how I remembered it from the last re-read but a great ending]

[08/08/2022]

Children of Time - Adrian Tchaikovsky [Incredible feat of imagination. Amazing ending]

[27/10/2022]
Recursion - Blake Crouch [Physical book. Re-read. Amazing read as expected. On this re-read, the first half was just as exciting as my first time reading, the middle a bit slow, the ending was great though]


[20/03/2023]
The End of Eternity - Isaac Asimov [Entertaining read. Enjoyable ending. Liked Asimov's descriptions of time travel and terms for the temporal like homewhen, upwhen and downwhen]

[30/03/2023]
Blood Music - Greg Bear [Lukewarm entertaining read. Brilliant concept albiet pulpy writing. Love the title of the book - "Blood Music"]

[07/04/2023]
Me Before You - Jojo Moyes [Wonderful read. I really liked the characters and ending]

[03/05/2023]
Dogs of War - Adrian Tchaikovsky [Entertaining and surprisingly emotional sci-fi. My second Adrian Tchaikovsky novel after Children of Time.
                                  With his Zoology background, he's really good at writing anthropomorphic characters, describing animal characteristics and psychology in his works]

[21/06/2023]
Homo Deus - Yuval Noah Harari [An entertaining and thought provoking read even though a bit preachy at times.
                               Some of the topics explored were more interesting than Sapiens]
