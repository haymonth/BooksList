Stories Of Your Life and Others - Ted Chiang [Physical book. Brilliant writing in general. The first story "Tower of Babylon" was a bit underwhelming.
                                              "Understand" was a really fun read. I enjoyed "Liking What You See: A Documentary" the best; The concept of "calliagnosia" was thought provoking.
                                              "Seventy-Two Letters" and "The Evolution of Human Science" were good but not gripping.
                                              Didn't enjoy "Hell is the Absense of God". I wasn't able to appreciate the story or the message.
                                              The main story "Stories of your Life" that Denis Villeneuve's Arrival is based on was an interesting read but shorter than I expected and not as exciting in contrast to the film]

[01/07/2022]
